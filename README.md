# SkincareRecommendation
## What it does:
Our recommendation engine will provide recommendations based on a skincare profile (the user can input their concerns and optionally their skin type and skin sensitivity levels to better optimize the product recommendation) ensuring that all product conflicts and potential adverse reactions are avoided. The engine is built so that the most efficient/most targeted product possible is recommended over any other products - we have limited one type of product (as of now, we have water-based and moisturizer) to one specific concern for ease of use.
